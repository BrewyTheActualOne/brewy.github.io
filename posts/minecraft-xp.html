        <p class="maintext">
          This is a small guide to help you run Minecraft on Windows XP (and
          Vista) in the best way I know.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext-bold">Getting started - Update your OS</p>
        <p class="maintext">
          First of all, and this is very important, you will need to make sure
          your XP installation is fully updated, especially with TLS 1.2 and
          Certificates. Updating your OS beforehand will not only fix possible
          problems while setting the game up, but also ensure maximum possible
          security.
          <br />
          In order to learn how to update your system, make sure to read
          <a class="link-italic" href="xp-info.html"
            >Using Windows XP in modern times</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext-bold">Step 1 - Install Java</p>
        <p class="maintext">
          Obviously this is one of the most basic yet important steps, you can't
          play Minecraft Java Edition if you don't have Java installed.
          <br />
          Now you can go the easy way and get the outdated
          <a href="https://i430vx.net/files/XP/EOL/jre-8u152-windows-i586.exe"
            >Java 8u152</a
          >, which I'm sure isn't even advertized on the Java website anymore,
          but you can also use the Windows 32-bit version of
          <a href="https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild">OJDKBuild</a>
          1.8.0_322 which works fine on XP. Build 322 is a lot more recent than
          152!
          <br />
          Now that you have either version of Java installed, you can advance to
          the next step, which is choosing a launcher.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext-bold">
          Step 2 - Launchers (and the fuss with Microsoft accounts)
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          You have likely heard this many times: the Legacy Minecraft Launcher
          was discontinued due to Mojang's recent switch to Microsoft accounts.
          Now that the migration is basically over and users that don't want to
          switch will have their accounts disabled forcefully (or so I was
          told), the Legacy Launcher is unfortunately no longer an option.
          <br /><br />
          However, we are not limited to just the official Minecraft launcher.
          There are many third party launchers that work just as good, or even
          better. Many people prefer MultiMC, but unfortunately the latest
          version of it does not appear to play well with Microsoft accounts.
          While older versions do tend to work, digging them out is painstaking
          and likely not worth the effort to mess with, plus they will probably
          become outdated at some point.
          <br /><br />
          I would instead use a launcher known as TL (don't confuse it with
          TLauncher, they're completely different things!), developed by
          <span class="maintext-bold">turikhay</span> and available at
          <a href="https://tlaun.ch/jar" class="link-italic">tlaun.ch/jar</a>.
          <br />
          This launcher is great in that it supports official Microsoft
          accounts, old Mojang accounts, as well as "cracked" sessions and
          ely.by skins. Whatever your preferred way of playing Minecraft is, TL
          likely has you covered. It's also easy to configure and customize!
