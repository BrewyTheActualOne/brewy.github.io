          Using Windows XP in modern times - A comprehensive guide to keeping XP
          secure and up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          Sometimes, I hear people saying Windows XP is plain unusable in 2021.
          That is not true. You can still use Windows XP with great success,
          even 20 years later. In this post I'm going to get into the details of
          using Windows XP in modern times while ensuring maximum possible
          security and compatibility.

        <p class="maintext">
          First of all you have to get an ISO file. If you don't already have
          one, the best way to do it is to pop in the original XP CD if you have
          it, but if you don't, just grab one of the many ISO images on
          <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> and find a key online.
          Can't really get into the details for obvious reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          Next, you have to make a USB-based installation medium which will be
          much faster and comfortable to use than a CD. for that we are going to
          use WinSetupFromUSB. I prefer this app over Rufus because sometimes
          I've had Rufus just refuse to work on certain machines (while working
          well on others). On the other hand, WinSetupFromUSB works well in
          almost every case.

1. Run the program, select the needed USB drive.
2. Click on "Bootice" to format the USB drive.
3. Click on "Parts Manage".
4. Click "Format This Part".
5. File system: NTFS, Volume label: any (must not use spaces), do not change anything beyond that. Click on "start".
6. Once it's done, close Bootice.
7. Now, get to your CD, or ISO file, and mount it using a third party tool or open it using Windows Explorer if it works.
8. Check "Windows 2000/XP/2003 Setup" and click on the "..." button.
9. Lead it to your virtual drive, then click "Select Folder".
10. Accept the license agreement if it asks you to, then click "GO".</pre

        <p class="maintext">
          Once it's done flashing, set it as the primary boot device in the PC's
          BIOS (on some BIOS'es you have to set a "HDD" as primary, and then set
          which "HDD" in the secondary menu), and restart the PC. It should boot
          from your new USB drive. Select the first part of the setup, and then
          the second part of the setup.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          You should note that if your PC uses a SATA drive, you will need SATA
          drivers integrated into your installation media to proceed with
          installing. However a common workaround is enabling IDE legacy mode in
          the BIOS settings, which will make IDE-only programs work with SATA
          drives. You can later install a SATA controller driver from the
          installed system.

        <p class="maintext-bold" id="drivers">Getting drivers</p>
        <p class="maintext">
          When it's done installing, you should be greeted by the desktop. At
          this point you need to install the drivers, and it can be a real issue
          sometimes. There are several ways to install drivers: finding the
          original driver CD for your motherboard, using DPinst to install
          drivers that come in .cab format from the
          <a class="link" href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com"
            >Microsoft Update Catalog</a
          >, searching for drivers on the internet (hint: try
          <a href="http://driverpacks.net/driverpacks">DriverPacks</a>) or using
          a driver app like Snappy Driver Installer (you could also use SDI
          Origin, both are great apps but will take a while to download all of
          the needed drivers.). It's probably a good idea to drop the full
          version on a USB drive, but mine is only 8 GB so I ended up using the
          original driver CD and installing driver updates using DPinst.

          Take a look at
          <a class="link-italic" href="windows-software.html"
            >Getting updates and software for old Windows</a
          >, it's a pretty big list so I found it better to split it into a
          separate post.

          However, I find it useful to remind you about
          <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>. If you are in need of
          pretty much any file or software, chances are it's archived there. If
          not, try searching up the download link to your file in the Wayback
          Machine and see if it's there instead.

          Overall a pretty simple guide really, if you also make sure to read
          the post above you should get a fully working XP machine that is as
          modern as it gets. Hope you enjoyed this guide, and make sure to
          bookmark it if you can, because it will get updated as time goes.
