          <b>Well, hello there. Been a while.</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Seems I haven't properly touched this site in a while and it blew up
          overtime or something. People keep mentioning it on r/windowsxp, and
          if Imgur doesn't deceive me, the image post I linked in the software
          list has gained almost a whopping 20K views, which is unthinkable to
          me. I had no idea a silly little tech findings site being worked on by
          a 17 year old kid in his spare time was getting so much traffic.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lately I have been getting less inclined to edit this site and also
          really hesitant to check the XP subreddit and Discord server
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsxp/comments/11ls161/how_would_i_go_about_removing_the_cooler_to_get/"
            >due to the influx of kids</a
          >
          which led me to almost completely forget this thing even existed,
          having entered various other private communities and also being more
          focused on real life tasks. Coming back to this site after a while
          with a fresh mind gave me a couple of ideas on what I could improve,
          such as a few changes to the layout and styling, and updating the
          posts as I've been told they have a lot of dead links and outdated
          info.
          <br />
          <br />
          Doing this all alone with no suggestions or feedback is quite boring
          though, so I decided to make a shot in the dark and 'ressurect' my
          dead Discord server which was laying around from a shelved project for
          the last year. I'll be more active on that server and also respond to
          questions and issues regarding this website. I already have a couple
          of friends there so feel free to tune in and check out what I'm doing
          I guess. Also we could play some games together.

            >The invite for the Discord server in question</a
          >
          - this will be the main place for discussion and feedback regarding my
          site from now on.
          <br />
          <br />
          As for actual changes, at the time of writing this it's evening so
          I'll try to fix it up in the next few days. The current plans (in no
          particular order):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="maintext">
              Fix up the CSS so that the site looks better on large screens.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="maintext">
              Make a proper mobile layout, not necessarily anything complex but
              enough to make it readable on a phone screen.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="maintext">
              Fix up the dead links in the software list and update it with new
              entries.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="maintext">
              Update the XP guide with new stuff, more detailed information and
              reference pictures.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="maintext">
              Implement a way of leaving feedback and suggestions (GitHub
              issues?).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p class="maintext">
          Shoutouts to that dude who shredded his laptop keyboard trying to get
          to the motherboard lol.
