            Whoops! It seems you are actually browsing this site on Internet
            Explorer... It is recommended that you upgrade to a newer browser as
            you will lose a lot of compatibility with this website if you keep
            using IE.
          </p>

      <div class="maincontainer" style="max-height: 60%">
        <p class="maintext-title">Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p class="maintext">
          Here you will find all sorts of things related to old computers,
          operating systems and software, and trying to keep them usable in
          modern times. Hope you enjoy your stay.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          If your browser supports proper HTTPS and has up-to-date security
          certificates, you might want to try the
          <a href="https://skipster1337.eu5.org">secure</a> version of this
          website. Redirection is not enabled by default in order to make this
          site work with old(er) browsers.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          Also, I tried my best to make this work with mobile devices but due to
          the limitations imposed it is still a not-as-good experience. Use
          desktop computers where possible.
