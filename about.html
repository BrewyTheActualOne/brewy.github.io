        <p class="maintext">
          This site started back in early 2021 as a way for me to share my
          hobbies and my retro computing knowledge, as well as for expanding my
          web development skills. This is, like, the 4th rewrite of the website
          and I can say that with each one it gets even better. It still is
          kinda spaghetti code but is overall much nicer and readable than it
          was in the beginning. I hope to get this site even farther in the
          future if I find the possibility to do so.

          I'm skip (very original name, I know), also known as skipster-1337 on
          reddit. I consider myself someone who thinks early 2000's computers
          are pretty neat, mostly because I grew up with one. I also like them
          because they are fun to do random things with. Most people say they
          aren't worth anything (and they're partially right), but in fact they
          are quite capable of modern day things such as web browsing (to a
          certain extent).

          I have 3 older-than-usual computers in various stages of usability -
          an Acer Travelmate 2490 (Celeron M 430, 2GB DDR2, GMA 950, WinXP), an
          HP 550 (Core2Duo T5470, 4GB DDR2, Intel 965 iGPU, Win7), and my very
          first computer that is currently in storage (Sempron64 3K+, 1.5GB
          DDR1, VIA/S3G Unichrome Pro IGP, WinXP). Really I'm pretty happy with
          these machines as they were (and still are) great machines for their
          time.
